# Project Charter: Amazon Affiliate Blog Generator

## Project Overview

The Amazon Affiliate Blog Generator is an automated system designed to create, manage, and optimize affiliate marketing blogs that monetize through the Amazon Associates program. The system handles the end-to-end process of content creation:

1. Identifying trending topics with commercial potential
2. Selecting relevant Amazon products for promotion
3. Generating high-quality, SEO-optimized content with affiliate links
4. Publishing to a static blog site hosted on GitHub Pages
5. Tracking performance and applying data-driven optimizations

This tool enables individuals to build scalable passive income streams through affiliate marketing while minimizing the time investment traditionally required for content creation and blog management.
