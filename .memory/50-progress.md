# Project Trajectory: Amazon Affiliate Blog Generator

## Development History

### Phase 1: Initial Project Setup (Completed)

The first phase focused on establishing the foundational architecture and core modules of the Amazon Affiliate Blog Generator.

**Key Milestones:**
- Defined modular system architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Created core modules for content generation, publishing, and monitoring
- Implemented storage utilities for persistent data management
- Established two execution paths: CLI tool (main.py) and scheduled job (app.py)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Developed mock product generation system due to initial Amazon API constraints
- Created templating system for content generation
- Implemented GitHub Pages integration for publishing
- Added notification system for monitoring via Discord webhooks

### Phase 2: Content Generation Enhancement (Completed)

The second phase focused on improving the quality and SEO-friendliness of generated content.

**Key Milestones:**
- Integrated Claude AI for natural language generation
- Enhanced content structure with SEO best practices
- Improved templating system for different content types
- Added keyword density and optimization features

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive prompt template for Claude LLM
- Implemented front matter generation for Jekyll compatibility
- Added structured content sections (intro, reviews, buying guide, FAQs)
- Enhanced metadata generation for better SEO

### Phase 3: Current Adaptation (In Progress)

The current phase focuses on adapting the system to function without direct Amazon API access.

**Key Milestones:**
- Design Google Search-based product discovery approach
- Implement ASIN extraction and product data enrichment
- Update affiliate link generation to support both direct and search links
- Ensure compatibility with existing pipeline

**Technical Progress:**
- Analyzed Google Search integration requirements
- Identified product data extraction patterns from search results
- Documented affiliate link format requirements
- Prepared adaptation strategy for both app.py and main.py workflows

### Key Metrics

- **Codebase Size**: ~2,500 lines of Python code across 10+ modules
- **Test Coverage**: ~40% of core functionality
- **Development Velocity**: ~3 key features per week
- **Known Issues**: 5 open issues related to Google Search integration

## Issue Tracking

### Open Issues

1. **Google Search Rate Limits**
   - Description: Custom Search API has 100 queries/day limit on free tier
   - Impact: Limits development testing and production capacity
   - Mitigation: Implementing aggressive caching and batch processing

2. **ASIN Extraction Reliability**
   - Description: Amazon product URLs in search results have variable formats
   - Impact: Not all products can have ASINs reliably extracted
   - Mitigation: Implementing multiple regex patterns and fallback to search links

3. **Product Data Completeness**
   - Description: Search results don't consistently contain all product details
   - Impact: Generated content may have incomplete information
   - Mitigation: Adding fallback text and data enrichment where possible

4. **Content Quality with Limited Data**
   - Description: Less detailed product data might affect content quality
   - Impact: Potentially less compelling or detailed blog posts
   - Mitigation: Template adjustments to handle missing information gracefully

5. **Dual Execution Path Maintenance**
   - Description: Changes need to work with both main.py and app.py
   - Impact: Increased testing complexity and maintenance burden
   - Mitigation: Creating shared utility functions used by both paths

### Recently Resolved Issues

1. **Affiliate Link Format Validation**
   - Description: Ensuring generated affiliate links are properly formatted
   - Resolution: Implemented URL encoding and validation functions in amazon_utils.py

2. **Mock Data Transition**
   - Description: Designing transition from mock data to real Google Search data
   - Resolution: Created adapter pattern to maintain same output format with new data source

3. **Template Compatibility**
   - Description: Ensuring templates work with potentially limited data
   - Resolution: Added conditional rendering and fallbacks in templates

## Performance Benchmarks

### Current System Performance

- **End-to-End Generation Time**: ~45 seconds per blog post
- **Product Discovery Success Rate**: 65% (with mock data)
- **Content Generation Success Rate**: 95%
- **Publishing Success Rate**: 98%

### Target Performance

- **End-to-End Generation Time**: <60 seconds per blog post
- **Product Discovery Success Rate**: >80% with Google Search
- **Content Generation Success Rate**: >90%
- **Publishing Success Rate**: >95%

## Next Development Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. Complete Google Search-based product discovery implementation
2. Implement ASIN extraction from search result URLs
3. Enhance product data enrichment from snippets
4. Update affiliate link generation with fallback mechanisms
5. Test integration with both app.py and main.py paths

### Medium-Term Roadmap

1. Optimize API usage and implement efficient caching
2. Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Improve product ranking algorithms based on available data
4. Implement analytics for tracking affiliate link performance
5. Add support for batch processing to maximize API efficiency

### Future Considerations

1. Explore additional product data sources as alternatives/supplements to Google Search
2. Consider implementing web scraping with proper rate limiting (legal/ToS considerations needed)
3. Develop admin dashboard for monitoring system performance
4. Expand to support multiple affiliate programs beyond Amazon
