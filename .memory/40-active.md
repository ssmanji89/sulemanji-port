# Current Focus & State: Amazon Affiliate Blog Generator

## Active Sprint Priorities

### Primary Focus: Adapting System to Work Without Amazon API

The current development focus is on adapting the Amazon Affiliate Blog Generator to function effectively without direct access to the Amazon Product Advertising API. This involves implementing a Google Search-based approach for product discovery and ensuring the system maintains its end-to-end functionality.

#### Key Tasks in Progress

1. **Google Search Integration**
   - Design and implement product discovery via Google Search
   - Extract product details including ASINs from search results
   - Develop enrichment logic for product data when available

2. **Affiliate Link Generation**
   - Update link generation logic to work with both direct product links (when ASINs are found) and search links
   - Ensure proper URL encoding and validation for all generated links
   - Maintain compatibility with existing affiliate tracking methods

3. **Content Generation Adaptation**
   - Ensure templates work with potentially limited product data
   - Add fallbacks for missing attributes in content generation
   - Maintain SEO-friendly content structure

4. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Ensure changes work with both main.py and app.py execution paths
   - Preserve error handling and notification mechanisms
   - Maintain output compatibility with GitHub publishing

## Current Development Status

### Completed Work

- Initial project setup with modular architecture
- Mock product generation system (in `product_finder.py` and `product_selection.py`)
- Content generation and templating system
- GitHub publishing integration
- Basic monitoring and notification systems
- Command-line interface (main.py) for manual content generation
- Scheduled job architecture (app.py) for automated execution

### In-Progress Work

- Google Search-based product discovery module
- Product data enrichment from search snippets
- Testing and validation of generated affiliate links
- Integration with existing content generation pipeline

### Upcoming Work

- Quality assurance and validation of the adapted system
- Documentation updates reflecting the new architecture
- Performance optimization focusing on API efficiency
- Extended testing across various product categories

## Current Environment Setup

### Active Configuration

The development environment is currently configured with:
- Local Python 3.8+ environment with virtual environment
- Development credentials for Google Custom Search API
- Amazon Associates affiliate tag for testing
- Discord webhook for notification testing
- GitHub test repository for publishing verification

### Known Issues & Blockers

1. **API Limitations**
   - Google Custom Search API has daily query limits that may affect development testing
   - Search result quality varies by product category and search term specificity

2. **Product Data Completeness**
   - Extracting complete product data from Google Search results is challenging
   - Price and rating information may not be consistently available

3. **ASIN Extraction**
   - Amazon URLs in search results may have different formats, complicating ASIN extraction
   - Not all search results will include direct product links with ASINs

## Testing & Validation Approach

### Current Testing Focus

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - End-to-end generation process using various topics and keywords
   - Product discovery success rate across different niches
   - Affiliate link validation with Amazon's link checker

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - API call efficiency and rate limit management
   - Response time and completion rates for each module
   - Error rates during product discovery and enrichment

3. **Content Quality Assessment**
   - Evaluation of generated content quality
   - Completeness of product information in posts
   - SEO-friendliness of generated output

## Next Milestone Targets

1. **Feature Complete Adaptation**
   - Complete all core functionality for Google Search-based product discovery
   - Ensure seamless integration with both execution paths (app.py and main.py)
   - Achieve >80% product discovery success rate across test topics

2. **Quality & Reliability**
   - Reduce error rates to <5% in end-to-end execution
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
   - Complete documentation for the adaptation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize API usage to stay within free tier limits where possible
   - Implement efficient caching for search results
   - Reduce end-to-end execution time by 20%
