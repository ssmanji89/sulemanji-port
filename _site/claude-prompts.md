# Jekyll GitHub Pages Portfolio Prompts

## Initial Project Assessment Prompt

```
I'm working on my portfolio website (www.sulemanji.com) using GitHub Pages with Jekyll. Let's follow our established workflow for development:

1. First, use read_graph to review our project context and current status
2. Then, use desktop_mcp to explore the repository structure at /Users/sulemanmanji/Documents/GitHub/sulemanji
3. Use browser_mcp to examine the live site at www.sulemanji.com and identify current issues

Based on this exploration, use thinking_mcp to develop a structured plan for today's development tasks, focusing on:
- Jekyll-specific file structure and configuration
- Template and layout improvements
- Content organization within Jekyll's framework
- Performance optimizations for GitHub Pages

Remember to update memory_mcp after your assessment to maintain continuity between sessions.
```
